# Welcome to Architectures and Advanced Data Systems Course

## System requirements

You can get access to pre-built Linux or Windows Server (to your choice) with all environment installed, **so you don't need to install nothing**. 

If you still prefer working from your own machine, below is a list of tools that we will be using throughout the course:

- Git (any version...)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [AWS cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
